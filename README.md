The Ducted Assembly Steady State Heat Transfer Software (DASSH) is an open-source tool for calculating temperature and flow distributions in hexagonal, ducted assemblies comprised of wire-wrapped pin bundles. DASSH is intended for use during the design process to provide a rapid assessment of the flow and temperature distribution, especially when assembly designs are in their early stages and not fully developed.

## Installation
Detailed installation instructions can be found in the [user guide](https://github.com/dassh-dev/documents/blob/master/user_guide.pdf).
