The Ducted Assembly Steady State Heat transfer code (DASSH) is an open-source tool for calculating temperature and flow distributions in hexagonal, ducted assemblies comprised of wire-wrapped pin bundles. DDASSH is intended for use as part of the reactor design process to provide a rapid assessment of the flow and temperature distribution, especially when assembly designs are in their early stages and not fully developed.
